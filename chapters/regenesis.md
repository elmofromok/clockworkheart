#  Regenesis


It took almost an hour to prepare the room for his second experiment of the night. He had cleared a path of the debris and dragged his remaining table under the box. He had climbed up on the table to make sure that the distribution box was still going to work and to carefully bend the black arms back into place. Satisfied that it would he had carried the girl from the hallway as gently as he could to the table. 

He stripped of her clothes carefully, hoping to avoid disturbing the wound in her chest. He found himself looking at her naked body for a moment, but was not sure if his growing excitement was from seeing her flesh or from the daring operation he was about to attempt.

The storm continued to rail against the house; rain slapping, lightning flashing and thunder shaking. 

It is the symphony of my greatest success, or the dirge of my greatest failure..  Phineas thought as he bent over the girl and let his hand slowly caress her face. He let his hand move slowly down her throat, feeling the weak pulse of her failing heart against his fingers. He brushed it across her young breast, the nipple tight and stiff against the cool night air. Finally, he wrapped his hand around the long deadly piece of wood that impaled her. 

With a slow deep breath, he closed his eyes and pulled with all his might. The wood wrenched free of her torso with a sickening sound and her eyes opened abruptly, her mouth open to scream, but she instead fell back hard against the table and stared blanky forward. A ragged breath fell from her as she died.

Wasting no time, Phineas grabbed a scalpel and cut four small incisions in her chest, each radiating a different direction from the wound. He pulled the skin roughly back in each direction, making enough room to work in. Satisfied, he reached over to the right and carefully picked up the purple gemstone, which was now resting in a mount he had modified slightly to fit within her wound, and pressed it down into her chest, nestled tightly into the wound. Small brass nails pressed into the bone of her breastbone and held. Folding the skin flaps back, he pressed the wound closed over the small brass mount as well as he could making sure to leave the stone itself exposed.

He reached above his head and flipped the toggle that would allow the energy from a lightening strike to move into the box over head and then down into the stone. 

He moved back now. There was nothing to do but wait. 

and hope.

When the strike finally happened, Phineas was starting to despair. The girl had been dead for so long that he was no longer sure if the stone could bring life back to her. If it worked at all. 

But with a flash the storm unleashed a strike into the rods above, a furious blast that drive hard into the box and finally down the black metallic arms to jump the small gap to the purple stone that lay in the girls chest.

Her body arched as the energy coursed through her. Her muscles contracted and her hair stood out on end. He could hear what could only be her skin cooking and could barely stand to watch. 

She suddenly stopped arching her back and lay back against the table. The lightning ended its torment of her and the room grew dark once more. 

Then the stone in her chest began to glow. It was barely noticeable at first, but soon filled the room with purple light.

The girl gasped and began to breath. Her eyes closed and she relaxed against the table. She was asleep.

He moved closer to her and watched. He looked closely at the stone and the brass mount, and at the wounded flesh that still shown beneath it around the edges, blood dried and dark.

Then he realized that the wounds were closing. She was healing. Or rather the stone was healing her.

It was going to work! The stone had bonded with her. It would heal her. 

He was not sure how long it would take for her to heal enough to wake, but he did not want it to be while nude laying on a table in an attic workshop. He moved quickly, wrapping her in a soft quilt he had brought up from below and then carried back to the bedroom. 

Once she was tucked safely into the bed, he got a fire started in the bedrooms fireplace and then sat on a nearby chair and waited. After a while, the spider crawled into his lap and waited with him.
