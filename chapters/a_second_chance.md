# A Second Chance


He was sleeping awkwardly when she woke. The creak of the bed shocked him out of sleep, and when he opened his eyes she was sitting at the edge of the bed crying. 

He lurched up out of the chair, sending the metal spider scurrying for it's life, and moved to the bed.

"Are you ok? Does it hurt?", He asked.

She looked up at him, tears drying on her face. She opened her mouth to speak but hesitated. She looked back at the floor, at her feet and quietly said, " Nah. No. It feels.. I.. There ain't no pain. It.. I.. "

She stopped and simply shook her head.  She looked up at him with a face that pleaded for understanding.

Finally, she asked, "Why am I here?"

Unsure what she meant, Phineas replied, "Here? In this room? Or alive?"

She nodded.

He leaned back at bit and sighed. "Well. There was an accident, and you were injured. um.. badly... and I. well.. I fixed you."

He waved his hand at her chest, which glowed faintly through the hole in her  shirt. "I used a taliman stone. It will keep you alive... and strong"

"But... I was .. I was dead right?" She looked at him. "I fell and then that thing stuck me like a pig an.." She stopped. Thinking.. 

"Why am I not wit God? I died!?"

"The stone is powerful life magic. Once activated it will keep you alive."

She looked down at her chest. At the glow there.

"How long?"

"I do not know. I expect a long time. Has it healed fully? Are you ok?"  He reached forward and opened the torn hole in your shirt. 

She recoiled from him, reaching out and pulling the shirt closed.
