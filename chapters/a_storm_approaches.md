# A Storm Approaches
\label{cha:a_storm_approaches}

Phineas Crane leaned out over the railing and watched the stormclouds as they roiled and blossomed, miles out at sea. The dark shapes stretched from horizon to horizon, darkening the otherwise calm summer day. He watched as the motley fleet of fishing boats that fed Havorsport begin pulling up nets and returning to the safety of the bay. So many beaten weathered hulks limping their way home. 

Tonight would be the night. He could feel it, deep within his soul. He could barely contain the impatience that tried to consume him, wanting to drive him forward haphazardly. He clenched his jaw for the hundredth time that night, ignoring the tension headache building at the base of his skull. 

He reached down and tugged the chain of his pocket watch, pulling it from his pocket to see the time. He held it in his rough hands and gazed at it, a beautiful if battered thing of silver and brass. So close to his grand success, he began to feel nostalgic for his fathers workshop. He began to remember.

His father had made the watch for a wealthy merchant many years ago, and when the merchant rebuffed it as inferior (more for political reasons than for any lack of workmanship)  his father had tossed it at him his face red with rage. “Find the flaw, if you can!” He had said angrily before storming off into the far reaches of the great mansion overlooking Starlock by the Sea. 

Phineas had taken the watch apart over a hundred times and pieced it back together.  At first, he had found it perfect and beautiful. He could find nothing wrong with the design. So he decided to see if he could change things and have the watch still work. He begin to experiment and the more he experimented, the more he begin to see tiny imperfections. Small grooves that interfered with the timing. Ridges that could be smoothed to increase the amount of time between windings. Tiny, subtle things that could make his fathers watches better.

After making enough of these discoveries, he had burst into his fathers workshop and began to breathlessly tell him how his work could be improved. His father had listened at first, but then blood began to rush to his face, and his eyes grew wide and he slapped Phineas hard across the face. He threw Phineas from the workshop and slammed the door in his face. 

The next day Phineas was awoken to the sound of his things being packed away. By mid morning he was bustled onto a train, and on his way to a boarding school in the city. He was ten.



A clap of thunder startled him and he realized he was staring at the watch without actually seeing the time. He blinked a few times before flipping open the silver case to see the watch face within. He frowned as he realized that the girl should have been here before now. Had he missed the bell somehow? Was she waiting for him on the porch at this very moment? Would she turn and go back to town instead of waiting for him to come to the door?

“Damn unreliable girl!” He turned from the storm and the crashing sea and returned to the wonderful clutter of his workshop. He brushed past the shiny gears and piles of springs and headed to the old creaky staircase that lead down to the house proper. 

He quickly made his way down the two flights of stairs, the old house groaning and protesting his every step. At the bottom, he hurried down the hallway, past the living room he had not set foot in since purchasing the house many years ago, and into the foyer with the grand front door. He reached for the door handle just as the great brass bell began to went BONG a few inches above his head vibrating his skull. 

“Fucking hounds of hell!”, He screamed as he leaped back against the umbrella stand, sending his canes and umbrellas spinning across the floor of the foyer and out into the hallway beyond.  Phineas leaned back against the hallway holding his hands to his head as the huge bell continued to intone its important message, filling the large house with reverberations that were specifically designed to be clearly heard in the workshop, three stories above. 

Grabbing a cane from the floor, Phineas righted himself, and then with one hand against the wall to steady himself, he swung the cane hard at the bell, breaking the mount and sending it flying down the hall. The great full sound of the bell bounced away down the hall until it rolled under a dusty sofa and was finally silent. 

Angrily, he grabbed the door handle again, and wrenched the door open to see a young girl with blonde hair and an armful of packages wrapped in brown paper. She was holding the the silver chain that had been attached to the bell a second before but now hung limply across her hand and dangled down to the floor, running over her feet. Her mouth was open as if to speak and her eyes were wide and terrified. 

Seeing Phineas Crane suddenly appear in the doorway, his face full of wrath and fury as thunder echoed in the near distance, she reflexively took a step back, but her shoe tangled with silver chain and she lost her balance.  Her eyes grew even wider as she began to fall backwards toward the long rickety stairs that lead out onto the beach. 

Phineas reached forward but was unable to halt her slow fall backwards. The brown paper packages scattered into the air around her as she reached out with her arms, desperately trying to find purchase on the old wooden railings that lay barely out of reach. 

She cried out as she fell, and then hit the wooden stairway hard, her cry cut off with the sudden impact. She continued to tumble down the stairs her arms and legs flopping limply around her before coming to a violent sudden stop against one of the posts that held the railing.

She did not move.

Phineas stood frozen in the doorway, one hand reached out to grasp the empty air, the other gripping the door handle with white knuckles.

“Oh shit… fuck.. shit.. hell… no… no.. ”,  he began to whisper to himself absently.

His mind raced across the possible outcomes. He began to discount possibilities as he scanned the beach for companions or witnesses. The path up the beach into the trees was empty. He spotted no one. She must have come alone.

He returned his attention to the girl. Blood was pooling on the stair beneath her head, it was seeping over the edge and into the cracks to fall in fat drops into the shallow water beneath. 

He closed his eyes and leaned against the doorframe. His mind danced through the possibilities. He should go to town to get help. He should find her parents. He should summon the constable. They would come and help. 

He took a couple of hesitant steps down the stair, and then stopped. They would come and then they would have questions. They would want to discuss what happened. They would want to determine blame.

He looked out across the sea at the storm clouds that darkened that skies. They were so much closer and so full of promise. So much raw energy waiting to be tapped and controlled. So much potential.

He craned his neck to look up at the workshop, clutching to the top of the house like a great wooden nest of some huge wooden seabird. Long metallic rods stuck out from the roof, reaching out into the darkening sky, waiting to tap into such great power. Those rods represented the last ten years of his life. They were the culmination of everything he had been working towards since he left the boarding school. His chance to prove himself. To make his father proud. 

His father would not live much longer based on the letters. He would not get another chance. The watch felt heavy in his pocket.

He made his decision. 

He walked down the stairs to the girls still form. He reached down and gathered her up, and with a final glance around, carried her up and into his house.

A few moments later, he returned for the brown paper packages.
