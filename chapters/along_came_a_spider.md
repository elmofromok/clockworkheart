# Along Came A Spider

When the full fury of the storm hit, it shook the whole house in greeting.  Great gusts of wind and loud, heavy raindrops hammered the windows that led out onto the balcony. The weak lights in the workshop flickered and a box of gears feel from a shelf to clatter across the floor.  

Phineas looked up, his eyes huge in the magnifying lens that covered his face. He watched the gears roll around for a second and then bent back over the small shiny spider shaped casing that lay open on the table before him. It was 6 inches across, with eight silver and brass legs that spread out onto the table around it. Thousands of tiny gears and wires filled the carapace, each catching the light in a slightly different way. Phineas found it very beautiful. 

Satisfied that all the pieces were exactly where he meant them to be, he reached over and into one of the opened brown paper packages. He carefully lifted out the two small purple gems within, and held one of them up to the light. It was flawless. The light moved through it and somehow became more intense. brighter. He could feel the energy of the stone as it pulsed against his finger tips. They were exceedingly rare and it had taken most of his remaining money to purchase the two of them and have them shipped in. He had made the order many months ago  and even so it had barely made it in time. If it had been delivered, a few days later...

His thoughts drifted to the girl that lay haphazardly across a bed in the dark house below, but quickly he pushed the thought down and refocused. She could not be helped now. 

Gently, he placed the purple gem into it’s spot within the gears and wires of the small gleaming carapace. He felt it snap into place and with a relieved sigh,  straightened up on his stool. 

The workspace flashed as lightening outside filled the workshop with sudden brightness. Phineas looked up nervously at the polished wooden box that hung suspended from the ceiling above. Great bundles of wires and metal tubes connected the box with the huge metal rods that went through the roof and out into the raging night.  The box was silent and dark. 

Relieved, he quickly carried the carapace to the small raised platform directly beneath the huge box. Six black metal arms reached out from the wooden box, each running away from the box parallel to the ground before curving back in towards the platform. The arms ended in sharp points arrayed in a six pointed circle about 4 inches across. He thought it appropriate that this gave the box the appearance of a large dancing spider. 
 
He could feel the hairs on his arms stand up as he moved closer to the metal arms. It would not be long now. 

He set the spider on the platform, directly beneath the black metal arms. He made a few small adjustments on the arms, so that each was the same distance from the purple stone and the finally stepped away.

He turned his head watching the storm outside the windows, his hands gripping tightly into fists. 

The house shook as lightening struck the rods above, so close that the thunderclap hit almost the same instance as the flash. The workshop filled with intense bright light as natures fury traveled down the rods and into the wooden box. The box began to hum and glow with energy as it charged with the power of the storm. 

The black metal arms began to glow with a blue white aura. With a loud high pitched buzzing, white hot energy danced down the black metal arms, and then leaped across the gap and into the purple stone that was the heart of the spiders body.

The stone began to glow an intense rich purple that soon outshine even the lightning itself, filling the workspace with deep purple shadows amidst the stark white light. 

Phineas sat enraptured with what he was seeing. His years of work finally happening as he had imagined. Unaware of the tears that streaked his face, he began to laugh hysterically. 

Movement at the doorway distracted him and he glanced up to see a pale blonde shape squinting at the worktable in shock. She raised her arms to shield her face as the intense light bathed her in radiance.

Phineas straightened up in startled amazement. She’s alive! Unbelievable!  

He started forward, reaching out to her. He started to tell her it was ok, to go back to the bedroom and rest. The words formed on his lips but as he began to speak, the work table exploded.

Phineas was thrown back violently against the bookshelf behind him. He collapsed to the ground as books and jars and thousands of screws and gears and bolts cascaded down around him, followed by the heavy wooden bookshelf itself.

He lay stunned for many moments beneath the pile of knowledge and tools of creation. Finally, he began to dig himself out painfully. His head rang and his shoulder was on fire, but slowly he crawled out of the mess and stood up.
He swayed slightly as he surveyed the workshop. The table was destroyed, burnt pieces of wood scattered around the shop.  The steel arms hung at an odd angle, bent and twisted.

Suddenly, he remembered and looked toward the doorway where two legs stuck in from the hallway, the small faded brown shoes pointed at the ceiling.

“Hello! You hurt?!”

He stumbled over the wreckage until he was at the doorway. She lay there gasping, eyes wide with shock, staring at him. Her face was even paler than before, and it was spotted with tiny dots of blood. A long sliver of wood stuck out at an angle from between her breasts, bouncing with each gasp.

“oh hells.” He breathed quietly. How many times am I going to kill this girl?

Something bumped against his boot. He stumbled back, startled. Looking down, he was amazed to see the small brass spider crawling over the injured girls leg. Purple light shone from the still open carapace. One of it’s legs was bent awkwardly, but the creature seemed to be adapting to it. It had worked!!

He bent down and retrieved the spider. It was warm in his hands. He carefully closed the top, feeling it click shut securely. It’s legs moved spastically as it tried to get free of his grasp. He laid it down and watched it scurry down the hall a few feet and the spin around. It actually seemed to be watching him now.

A choking sound snatched his attention back to the dying girl at his feet. He frowned and knelt down beside her. 

“Oh dear.. What to do about you...”  He studied the wound, trying to find a way to remove it without killing her. 

He stood abruptly and went down the hallway, startling the spider which quickly skittered to the wall and crawled up it. He stopped at a closed door, opened it and went inside the room beyond. He came out a few moments later with a large leather bag in one hand and a rag in the other. 

He returned to the girls side and set the bag down. She watched him with wide eyes, but what life she held there was fading away slowly. Her breath was slowing and there was a lot of blood on the floor.

Phineas reached into the bag and pulled out a bottle of clear liquid. He pulled the worn cork free and poured some of the liquid onto the rag. “This will help with the pain. And let me get this horrid thing out of you. Don’t worry, I was almost a Doctor once.”

He reached over and held the rag over mouth and nose tightly. “Breath in. There’s a good girl.” She convulsed, and struggled feebly for a few seconds before relaxing back into silence. Her eyelids fluttered briefly before closing and her head lolled to the side against the floor.

“ahh there... What do I do now?”  He looked up at the shiny spider clinging to the wall above him. “Any ideas?” 

He leaned back against the wall and slumped, suddenly exhausted. He began to realize how badly his body hurt after the explosion. 

What happened??  He closed his eyes and tried to determine why the device had overloaded. It should have been able to handle that much lightning easily. What had he missed?

Struggling to his feet, Phineas stepped carefully over the prone girl and moved into the workshop. There was a thick haze in the air, and the smelt of burnt wood. Phineas had a sudden oddly pleasant memory of when he was younger and they would burn wood around his fathers estate for warmth, filling the air with smells much like this. 

He looked up at the box hanging from the rafters above. The wood was cracked and bent but seemed to have survived the blast for the most part. The brunt of the energy seem to have come from lower, down by the table itself. 

Why wasn’t the spider more damaged? That did not seem to make any sense. 

Phineas ran his fingers through his greasy hair and sighed. 

The table itself was destroyed. Almost entirely gone. The tools that had been on the table were tossed about the room, as were the boxes that..

The Boxes! Phineas leap forward and began digging frantically through the debris, searching for the brown paper package that contained the other purple gemstone. The nearly priceless purple gemstone he would have a very very hard time replacing.

Finally, he found under some books nearby. The brown paper that wrapped the box was singed in a few places, and the box was bent more than it had been but amazingly the stone was still inside. Phineas pulled the stone and examined it. 

He turned it carefully in his fingers, examining every side of the gem. It appeared to be unharmed. 

Phineas relaxed and let out the breath he had been holding in panic. If the stone had been damaged it would not be able to be charged and would not be able to hold the life needed to animate the devices he had designed.

Hold the Life...

The thought stuck in his mind. He chewed on it and then cocked his head to side, looking at the feet that still stuck in the doorway. 

An audacious plan began to form in his brain.
